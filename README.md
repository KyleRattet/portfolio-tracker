#Stock Porfolio - Performance Tracker

##Objective
To create a savable performance tracker for a user's portfolio of stocks. The tracker will enable the user to login, get real time updates on current and potential stock positions. Users will have the ability to input a stock ticker to get a current market quote, as well as enable the user to enter into a buy or sell transaction for the security.  Once a user takes a position, their portfolio will reflect the details of that transaction, (i.e. purchased 10 shares of AAPL@$110.00 on October, 4th). Users will be able to edit their portfolio holdings, via a buy or sell transaction of current holdings, or by taking a new investment position.
